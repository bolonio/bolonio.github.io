Some months ago, following some accessibility experts in twitter and attending some online conferences,
I end up meeting some people who created a new framework to develop more accessible website. This framework is called [PUXL Framework](https://puxl.io/).

> "PUXL framework is a free and open-source and eco-friendly library to create front-end Web interfaces. It helps you build accessible and responsive sites with lightweight HTML."
>
> Source: PUXL Framework website

I started to get to know the people behind the project, I joined their slack discussions, and I finally decide to take a look at the framework.
I started taking a look at the [accessible PUXL icons library](https://puxl.io/puxl-icons/),
an open source collection of more than 300 SVG icons custom tailored for PUXL framework, each with its own accessible title and description.

Since I develop in React, I wanted to be able to use those SVGs as React components,
so I decided to create a React icons library based on the collection of accessible PUXL icons library. Let me tell you a bit how I did it.

## What do I need to create and publish a React package to npm?

First of all I wanted to publish my React package to npm,
so everyone can install it directly in their React projects without downloading the whole SVGs library and creating a new folder with them in the project.

I published a React component as a package to npm in the past, [a simple and minimal React input range component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-component-range),
but that was a year ago, and React and npm changed a lot, so I need to look for more information about what were the steps to do it nowadays,
and I found this great [guide to publishing a React package to npm](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-complete-guide-to-publishing-a-react-package-to-npm/).
He basically created a [template of a projec ready to be publish in npm](https://github.com/ovieokeh/npm-react-typescript-template), so that reduced my developing setup a lot.
Of course, if you want to develop a React package, you need to be familiar with React, typescript and the npm registry. So now that the project setup was done, how do I continue?

## How did I transform all SVGs into React components?

As I said before, I wanted to avoid downloading the whole SVGs files and creating a new folder with them in the project.
I really wanted to be able to import every icon individually as I needed it as a react component.
As well, I wanted to be able to pass some props to the component, or at least three attributes that I think were relevant for an SVG icon component: width, height, and fill.
Like this, I would be able to size the icon and to color it.

The structure of one of the SVG icon looks like this. Each icon comes with its own accessible title and description.

```svg:title=icon_accessibility.svg

    />
  </g>
</svg>
```

It seemed obvious for me that I couldn't make more than 300 React components simply copying the SVG code into the .tsx files, so I needed to find a better way to automatize the process.
My first idea was to create a script that could read the content of the SVG file and then insert it into the .tsx file,
so I started using the "fs" library in javascript to manipulate the file system. I quickly failed and I started researching in the Internet for a solution,
because I was sure I was not the first person to have this idea. And then I remember that at work, we do something very similar with our design system to generate our icons,
so I took a look at the project, and there it was the solution, SVGR.

[SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) is a library that transforms SVG into ready to use components. It was the perfect solution for my idea,
so I started reading the documentation and experimenting with the library. It was very easy to start using it,
I just needed to install the SVGR CLI in my machine and start using it from the terminal.

After some experiments, I end up creating a new script option in my package.json file to generate all SVG icons from a folder. It looked something like this:

```json:title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate:icons": "svgr -d ./src ./resources/icons"
  }
}
```

So now I could run the script in my terminal and all my icons would be converted to React components

```bash
$ npm run generate:icons
```

But when I take a look at the generated javascript code I saw a couple of issues. The first issue was that the title and the description were not rendered,
the second issue was that all ids were, as well, not rendered, and the third issue was that the react component was rendered in javascript and not in typescript.

```jsx:title=IconAccessibility.js
import * as React from "react"

function SvgIconAccessibility(props) {
  return (
    <svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" {...props}>
      <g aria-labelledby="t-accessibility d-accessibility">
        <path d="M16 19.1s.4 0 .7 1l2.4 7.3c.2.5.801.8 1.301.6s.812-.8.604-1.3L18.6 19.6c-.4-1.1-.6-2.4-.6-3.6v-2.7c0-.368.078-1.394 1.189-1.524 2.474-.292 4.854-.766 5.006-.795a.998.998 0 00.785-1.176 1.005 1.005 0 00-1.176-.785c-.049.009-4.939.98-7.804.98s-7.755-.971-7.804-.98a.999.999 0 10-.392 1.96c.144.029 2.533.503 5.007.795C13.922 11.906 14 12.932 14 13.3V16c0 1.2-.2 2.5-.6 3.6L11 26.7c-.2.5.1 1.1.6 1.3s1.1-.1 1.3-.6l2.4-7.301c.3-.999.7-.999.7-.999z" />
        <circle cx={16} cy={7} r={2} />
        <path d="M16 0C7.2 0 0 7.2 0 16s7.2 16 16 16 16-7.2 16-16S24.8 0 16 0zm0 31C7.8 31 1 24.3 1 16S7.8 1 16 1s15 6.8 15 15-6.7 15-15 15z" />
      </g>
    </svg>
  )
}

export default SvgIconAccessibility
```

So I went back to the SVGR documentation and I found the flags to fix some of the issues "out of the box", and some others that need a bit more work.
Finally I found out that what I needed was a [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) config with some options to include and exclude some things in my final component.
I wanted to keep the viewbox, the title, and the description, and wanted to keep the ids as well, but SVGR prefix them all with `prefix__` to make them unique.
This is a great feature, but since I know that all the icons have unique ids, I wanted to delete that prefix as well. My final SVGO config looks like this:

```json:title=svgoConfig.json
{
  "plugins": [
    { "removeTitle": false },
    { "removeViewBox": false },
    { "removeDesc": false },
    { "cleanupIDs": false },
    { "prefixIds": false }
  ]
}
```

I changed the script to add the `--typescript` flag, the `--svgo-config` flag with the SVGO config,
the `--icon` flag to replace the "width" and "height" value by "1em" in order to make the SVG size inherits from the text size, and the final version looked like this:

```json:title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate:icons": "svgr --icon --typescript --svgo-config ./scripts/svgoConfig.json -d ./src ./resources/icons"
  }
}
```

So now I could run the new script in my terminal again

```bash
$ npm run generate:icons
```

And the final version with title, description, all ids, width and height, viewbox, and rendered as a typescript React component was:

```ts:title=IconAccessibility.tsx
import * as React from "react"

function SvgIconAccessibility(props: React.SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>) {
  return (
    <svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" width="1em" height="1em" {...props}>
      <g id="accessibility" aria-labelledby="t-accessibility d-accessibility">
        <title id="t-accessibility">{"Accessibility"}</title>
        <desc id="d-accessibility">
          {"A human, standing with arms extended, in a circle"}
        </desc>
        <path d="M16 19.1s.4 0 .7 1l2.4 7.3c.2.5.801.8 1.301.6s.812-.8.604-1.3L18.6 19.6c-.4-1.1-.6-2.4-.6-3.6v-2.7c0-.368.078-1.394 1.189-1.524 2.474-.292 4.854-.766 5.006-.795a.998.998 0 00.785-1.176 1.005 1.005 0 00-1.176-.785c-.049.009-4.939.98-7.804.98s-7.755-.971-7.804-.98a.999.999 0 10-.392 1.96c.144.029 2.533.503 5.007.795C13.922 11.906 14 12.932 14 13.3V16c0 1.2-.2 2.5-.6 3.6L11 26.7c-.2.5.1 1.1.6 1.3s1.1-.1 1.3-.6l2.4-7.301c.3-.999.7-.999.7-.999z" />

        <path d="M16 0C7.2 0 0 7.2 0 16s7.2 16 16 16 16-7.2 16-16S24.8 0 16 0zm0 31C7.8 31 1 24.3 1 16S7.8 1 16 1s15 6.8 15 15-6.7 15-15 15z" />
      </g>
    </svg>
  )
}

export default SvgIconAccessibility
```

The script now generates more than 300 React components into my ./src folder, together with an .index.tsx file with all of the exports, so my library was ready to be tested.
Following the [guide to publishing a React package to npm](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-complete-guide-to-publishing-a-react-package-to-npm/),
after building my package, I linked the package to a new demo app, created with create-react-app, using `yarn link` to test it, so my package was ready to be published to npm.
I wrote a complete and meaningful documentation in the readme file, and I published it.

Now anyone can install it using npm or yarn

```bash
$ npm i --save react-puxl-icons

$ yarn add react-puxl-icons
```

And each icon can be individually imported into a React application like:

```tsx:title=App.tsx
import React from "react"
import { IconAccessibility } from "react-puxl-icons"

export const App = () => (
  <div>
    <IconAccessibility />
  </div>
)
```

The icons accept any SVG attribute as prop, as it would use in a SVG element in HTML, like:

```tsx:title=App.tsx
import React from "react"
import { IconAccessibility } from "react-puxl-icons"

export const App = () => (
  <div>
    <IconAccessibility width="3em" height="3em" fill="red" />
    <IconAccessibility width="5em" height="5em" />
    <IconAccessibility width="40px" height="40px" fill="green" />
    <IconAccessibility fill="blue" />
  </div>
)
```
